# Version 2020.7

* Add in hi-res support for rendering MAME natively at 1080P/HD, 4K/UHD and other resolutions
* Added in iCade support for tvOS 
* Steam Controller support, controller must be in [bluetooth mode and paired](https://support.steampowered.com/kb_article.php?ref=7728-QESJ-4420)
* Fixed issue where audio would stop when playing back content from another source or being interrupted by a phone call.
* Set the audio catefory to `AVAudioSessionCategoryAmbient` so MAME4iOS will play nice with other audio apps.
* Make the 🅐 🅑 🅧 🅨 layout consistent across iPhone and iPad.
* Added a `Nintendo Button Layout` option.  if enabled the 🅐 🅑 and 🅧 🅨 buttons will be swapped to match a Nintendo layout.  This option has no effect on a custom layout, or a physical game controller.
* Better handling for 2 Player games, a 1 Player and a 2 Player Start option will be on the in-game menu.  We try to detect how many Players, Inputs, and Coins the current game is looking for and try to adapt to that.
* Downgrade controllers, if you are trying to use Controller 3 on a game that only takes 2 inputs, Controller 3 will be mapped to Player 1.
* Controller Identify, when you hit `MENU` on a controller the Player number is displayed as the title of the in-game menu.
* Supports Controler trigger buttons `L2`, `R2`.  `MENU+L2` will Insert a `P2 COIN`, and `MENU+R2` will do a `P2 START`.
* Removed separate `Load State` and `Save State` from the in-game menu, to make room, the menu is cramped in landscape and tvOS
* 🅑 will exit a `MAME` menu
